"""
aqi_alerts.py

Reusable EPA-category-based hazard alert logic for AQI values (current
reading and/or forecasts). Kept as a standalone module -- not embedded
directly in dashboard.py's UI code -- so the same threshold logic can be
reused later for other notification channels (email/Slack) without
duplicating the EPA category definitions.

Threshold policy: an alert triggers when any reading is "Unhealthy" (EPA
AQI > 150) or worse, i.e. the point at which EPA guidance starts advising
the general public (not just sensitive groups) to reduce exposure.
