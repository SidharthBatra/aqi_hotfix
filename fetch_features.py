fetch_features.py

Step 1 of the AQI Feature Pipeline: cloud-based hourly fetch that writes
directly into the Hopsworks feature group train_model.py trains from
(aqi_karachi_features) -- no local files, so this runs unattended on
GitHub Actions.

REWRITE (2026-08-25) of the original local-CSV prototype. Two real
problems fixed, plus one latent bug caught along the way:

1. STATE PERSISTENCE. The original script tracked the previous reading
   (for change-rate features) and AQICN's last station timestamp (for
   staleness detection) in local files (aqi_features.csv,
   last_aqicn_state.json). GitHub Actions runners are stateless -- a
   fresh machine every hour, nothing carries over between runs. State now
   lives in Hopsworks itself: this script reads back the last
   CONTEXT_HOURS of rows from the feature group before computing
   anything, instead of relying on local files.

2. SCHEMA / TRAIN-SERVE CONSISTENCY. The original script wrote columns
   (ow_pm2_5, ow_aqi_index -- OpenWeather's 1-5 category, aqicn_*) that
   don't match aqi_karachi_features' actual schema, and never computed
   the continuous EPA-formula 'aqi' that IS the model's real target.
   Pushed as-is, live rows would have been unusable for training -- wrong
   columns, wrong units. Fixed by importing compute_true_aqi.py's exact
   EPA breakpoint + rolling-window functions (not reimplementing them) so
   live 'aqi' is derived identically to how the backfill's target was
   built -- including the 24h/8h TIME-BASED rolling windows, which need
   the last ~24h of context, not just this hour's instant reading. That
   context is what the Hopsworks read in fix #1 provides.

3. LATENT UNIT-MISMATCH BUG. AQICN's API returns each pollutant's own AQI
   SUB-INDEX ("iaqi", already on a 0-500 scale), not a raw concentration
   in ug/m3. The original script's structure implied AQICN readings could
   fill in for OpenWeather's pollutant fields on failure -- but that would
   silently mix AQI sub-indices into columns that are supposed to hold raw
   ug/m3 concentrations (what the training data and the EPA formula both
   expect). So AQICN here is a cross-check / staleness signal ONLY --
   logged, never written into the pollutant columns. If OpenWeather fails
   for an hour, this script skips that hour's Feature Store insert rather
   than filling it with wrong-unit AQICN data or a fabricated value. A
   documented missing hour is a gap train_model.py's hourly-grid
   reindexing already handles correctly; a silently wrong hour is not.

NOTE: like the other Hopsworks-touching scripts written this session,
this hasn't been run against your live project from this environment --
only syntax-checked and logic-smoke-tested with synthetic context data.

INCIDENT (2026-09-01): before the hour-flooring fix below existed, this
script wrote 'timestamp_utc' straight from OpenWeather's 'dt' (real
minutes/seconds, e.g. 12:17:33) instead of flooring to the hour like the
backfill's History API rows. train_model.load_and_prepare_grid()'s exact
hourly reindex silently dropped every one of those rows, so the pipeline
ran green for days while contributing nothing -- see dashboard staleness
investigation. The ~4 rows already inserted at misaligned timestamps are
left in the feature group as harmless orphans (they still won't land on
the hourly grid, so they're simply ignored by training/inference) rather
than deleted or reinserted -- not worth the cleanup for 4 rows.

SELF-HEALING (2026-09-05): GitHub Actions scheduled runs are best-effort
and get silently dropped under load, so a run missing a few hours is
expected, not exceptional -- manually re-running backfill_gap.py every
time was not sustainable and let the dashboard silently re-break between
manual runs. Every run now reconciles rather than blindly appending one
row: it reads the newest hour-aligned row with a non-null 'aqi' from the
feature group first (see reconcile_missing_hours() below), and if it's
more than an hour behind, backfills the missing hours (capped at
MAX_HEAL_HOURS per run -- see that constant) using the exact same
OpenWeather-fetch + trailing-context rolling-aqi logic as
backfill_gap.py/backfill_historical.py, reused rather than duplicated,
before fetching and inserting the current hour as usual.

Requires HOPSWORKS_API_KEY and OPENWEATHER_API_KEY as environment
variables (GitHub Actions secrets in CI, Codespaces secrets locally).
AQICN_API_TOKEN is optional -- if unset, the cross-check/staleness log is
skipped but the pipeline still runs fine on OpenWeather alone.
