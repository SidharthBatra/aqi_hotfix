"""
Diagnostic: why does the dashboard show an old timestamp when the raw feature
group is being updated hourly?

Run this from the repo root in your Codespace:

    python scripts/diagnose_staleness.py

It needs HOPSWORKS_API_KEY in the environment (already set as a Codespaces
secret). It only READS from Hopsworks -- it writes nothing and changes nothing.

The hypothesis being tested: there is a gap in the raw feature group between
where the 2-year backfill ended and where hourly ingestion actually began.
Because features are built on a complete hourly grid, gap hours become NaN
placeholders, which makes the long rolling windows (aqi_rollmean_168h etc.)
NaN for every recent row whose 7-day lookback touches the gap. Rows with an
incomplete feature vector can't be fed to the models, so the dashboard falls
back to the newest fully-populated row -- the last row before the gap.
